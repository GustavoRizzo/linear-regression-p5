# Linear Regression with p5.js Visualization

## Introduction

**linear-regression-p5** is a project developed using Vite, React, TypeScript, and the p5.js library. The primary aim of this project was to both deepen my understanding of linear regression algorithms across a variety of scenarios and create an interactive web interface where anyone can experiment with different scenarios and observe real-time results, all thanks to the powerful p5.js visualization capabilities.

## Project Overview

### Technologies Used
- **Vite**: A fast, modern, and lean build tool for web development.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality and developer experience.
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library for creative coding, making it easy to visualize data and create interactive graphics.

### Project Features
- Interactive Interface: Allows users to experiment with different linear regression scenarios.
- Real-time Visualization: Provides immediate feedback on changes made, allowing users to observe the impact of alterations in real-time.
- Educational: Offers a practical way to learn and understand the concepts behind linear regression algorithms.
